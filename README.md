# This is a simple database

that caters to customers.




This study simulates a project
I had previously worked on for a customer. 
where the client's requirements 
were at the time, 
to program the front interface
 of a web application using Reactjs.


Well...
Here I first analyzed the project,
drawing and planning tables and entities,
and studying the relationship between 
each other.

This step is the basis for any project 
you will work on in the future.


As per customer's previous requirements, 
here we have 8 tables:
(order table, order item table,
 customer table, account table,
 menu table, menu item table,
 manager table, chef table)
